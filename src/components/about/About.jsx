                            Hello there! My name is Renjith Samuel and I am a passionate full-stack developer.
                            I am currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology.
                            My journey in the world of technology has been full of exciting challenges, from learning C
                              programming to mastering Reactjs.
                                                <div className='sepbetabt'>
                            
                                                </div>
                            I never thought I would enjoy the journey of problem-solving and learning new skills and technologies 
                            as much as I do now.
                            I consider myself as a curious learner, always in awe of every new thing I discover.
                            I believe that the road to mastering these skills is a lifelong adventure, and I
                            am ready to embrace it with open arms. As a software developer, I am constantly
                            seeking out new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.
                            <div className='sepbetabt'>
                            </div>
                            Recently, I have been particularly interested in Nodejs and web development.
                            I am amazed by the power of these technologies and their ability to transform
                            the way we interact with the digital world. In my work, I strive to create innovative
                            solutions that leverage the latest tools and techniques in order to build better, more
                              user-friendly applications.
